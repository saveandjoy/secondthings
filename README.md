# SecondThings

This material library has been created for [SaveAndJoy.fi](https://www.saveandjoy.fi) but it is recommended for any other
application where user experience is number one priority. This library is in constantly work-in-progress state
because we want to make sure that all the components that we use in Save&Joy are easy to use and well maintained.

You are free to contribute into this project, and we're always interested to make this library better.

## Available components

### `ThemeWrapper`
Component that wraps the application and serves a whole color palette for the application. This component
also includes functionality to check if the application is run on the mobile and if it's installed as PWA application.

### `Button`
Beautiful button that has primary and secondary variants.

### `Input fields and formcontroller`
Simple form-controller that passes data back with onChange property. Form controller supports text, numerical,
select, toggle and button select values. These components can also be called without form controller.

### `Datatable`
Datatable that which will be the industry top-tier solution for displaying data. It has properties for all the necessary needs.

### `Imagewrapper`
Basic image-wrapper
